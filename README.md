# YTM-Wrapper

YTM-Wrapper is a simple Electron-based macOS wrapper for YouTube Music, designed to allow **background playback** even when the window is closed. It supports media keys, system tray controls, and seamless playback without interruption.

## Features

- Background playback (music continues when window is closed)
- Media key support (Play/Pause, Next, Previous)
- System tray with playback controls and app visibility toggle
- Custom back button and navigation support
- macOS native look and feel with vibrancy and dark mode

## Why?

Unlike the web version or its installable PWA (Progressive Web App), this app allows your music to **continue playing** even when the app window is closed. Playback stops only when you explicitly quit the app.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedant-sharmaa/ytm-wrapper.git
   cd ytm-wrapper
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the app:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
